<h4>Guidelines</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The deadline hour is 23:55 on the deadline day.</li>
	<li>The exercises must be submitted via the <a href="http://moodle.tau.ac.il/course/view.php?id=509182099" target="_blank">Moodle</a> system</li>
	<li>Grades will be returned via the Moodle system, solutions will appear on the course website (here).</li>	
	<li>There will be 10 exercises: 6 during the first 6 weeks and 4 during the last 8 weeks.</li>
	<li>Exercises grades are 0, 60, 80, 90 and 100.</li>
	<li>Students must submit and pass (grade >= 60) at least 9 exercises to complete the course.</li>
	<li>The exercises grade will contribute 20-30% of the final grade, but only if the exam grade is >= 60. The exercises grade will be the average of the 9 best grades.</li>
	<li><strong>The exercises are personal and should be solved alone.</strong> Students are not allowed to solve exercises together, show solutions to other students or read other students' solutions.</li>
	<li>Exercises can be discussed without sharing code.</li>
	<li>Each student has 5 days of "grace" for late submissions. For each late submission we take off a full day (or days) of "grace", even it the exercise was submitted two minutes after the deadline. If a student has no more days of "grace", late exercises will not be checked and will be graded with a zero.</li>
	<li>In case of a late submission, students should <strong>not</strong> contact staff members. If the late submission is justified, students should attach the relevant documents (sick days, reserve duty etc.) to the submission, together with a <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/courses/0509-1820/1213a/misc/Submission-Problem-Report.doc" target="_blank">late submission form</a>. This includes cases in which there is a malfunction with the Moodle system.</li>
